What exactly is timezone? In common sense, time zone is a geographic area that shares common standard time. However, I would like to propose to different definition of time zone, regardless of geographic location. I believe we all live in our own time zone. Even people living in the same dorm have different time zone: some may wake up at 6 am, while others are night owls whose day starts at noon and ends at 3am. Yet, the interesting thing is that when individuals interact, our time zone start to merge and we will be in a same time space. In my art work, I use blobs to represent each individual's time zone. The blobs turbulate according to one's activity level. The blobs start to merge as individuals interact and come into the same "time zone".
