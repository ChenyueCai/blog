*Fig1, Self Portrait, 2021*

I am inspired by a wall painting outside an art museum in Oakland, where the artist use blob like letters to form a face. In this self portrait, I hide my name and my self image in the blobs. I am composed of morphable cells and it is these cells that allow my body and mind to grow. How would I end up being? I don't know. I choose to use the organic shapes to deliver the uncertainty.
