Only "true spiritual love" can "triumph over death, not a separation of the immortal from the mortal, of the eternal from the temporal, but a transfiguration of the mortal into the immortal, the acceptance of the temporal into the eternal. False spirituality is the denial of the flesh; true spirituality is the regneration of the flesh, its salvation, its resurrection from the dead".
