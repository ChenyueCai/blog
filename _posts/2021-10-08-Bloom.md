Imagine a world where flowers bloom every day. Would it be horrifyingly automatic or would it be evergreen? When nature is overtaken by the manmade when we no longer have realistic nature, what would our life be like? In this art piece, I created a video clip with automatic flower blooming. The tempo is intense, making what is supposed to be naturally beautiful into something synthetically automatic. I hope this discomfort could catch people's attention.
